# Case Study: Netflix – Personalized Recommendations with Machine Learning

---

## Challenge  

With thousands of movies and shows available, Netflix faces the **challenge of content discovery**.  
Users may feel overwhelmed by too many choices, leading to frustration and churn.  

Key business questions:  
- How can Netflix surface the most relevant content for each user?  
- How can personalization improve engagement and reduce churn?

## Solution  

Netflix leverages **machine learning-driven recommendation systems** to personalize the user experience.  

### Data Sources  
- **Viewing history**: what users watch, re-watch, skip, or abandon.  
- **Ratings & interactions**: likes, pauses, clicks.  
- **Content metadata**: genre, actors, keywords, release year.  
- **Contextual data**: device type, time of day, geography.  

### Methods  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: find patterns among users with similar preferences.  
- **Content-Based Filtering**: recommend titles with similar features.  
- **Hybrid Models**: combine multiple algorithms for better accuracy.  
- **A/B Testing**: constantly test and refine recommendation strategies.  

### Implementation  
- Personalized rows on homepage (“Because you watched...”, “Top picks for you”).  
- Regional and time-based recommendations.  
- Tailored artwork thumbnails to maximize clicks.

## Impact  

- **75% of viewer activity** is driven by recommendations.  
- **Higher retention**: subscribers stay longer, reducing churn.  
- **Improved engagement**: users spend more time on the platform.  
- **Revenue impact**: better retention → lower customer acquisition costs.

## Why This Matters  

Traditional streaming = generic top lists.  
Netflix’s approach = **individualized curation** → every user feels the app is designed for them.  

Data → Algorithm → Personalized Recommendations → Engagement → Retention.

## Considerations  

- **Echo chambers**: personalization can limit exposure to new genres.  
- **Transparency**: users may not understand why something is recommended.  
- **Balance**: must mix personalization with exploration.  

**KPIs:**  
- % of views from recommendations.  
- Average session time.  
- Churn rate reduction.  
- Customer lifetime value (CLV).
