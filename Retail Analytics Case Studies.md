# Case Study: Target – Predicting Customer Purchases with Machine Learning

---

## 1. Challenge (Business Problem)

Target wanted to understand customer purchasing patterns to increase sales.  

**Key issues:**
- Which products are customers most likely to buy next?  
- How can promotions be personalized to avoid wasting marketing spend?

## 2. Solution (Analytics Approach)

**Data used:**
- Customer purchase history (transactions, frequency, basket size).  
- Demographics (age, location, family situation, income).  

**Method:**
- Build machine learning models (e.g., classification, recommendation systems).  
- Predict:  
  - The next product customers are likely to purchase.  
  - The time window when they may need it.  

**Business actions:**
- Send personalized product recommendations via email, app, or direct mail.  
- Issue customized coupons tied to predicted customer needs.

## 3. Impact (Business Outcome)

- Higher relevance of promotions → better customer engagement.  
- Improved coupon redemption rate → more sales.  
- Reduced marketing costs since promotions are targeted instead of generic.  
- Long-term: improved customer loyalty because customers feel understood.

## Why This Matters

- **Traditional approach** = generic mass promotions → low redemption, high cost.  
- **Analytics-driven approach** = targeted, personalized offers → efficient marketing and higher ROI.  

The success relies on connecting:  
`Data (transactions + demographics) → Model (ML prediction) → Action (personalized offers) → Impact (higher sales & retention)`

## Takeaway

This is a textbook example of turning **data into business value**.  
Machine learning in retail is not just about prediction it’s about enabling **actionable strategies** that directly impact revenue and loyalty.
