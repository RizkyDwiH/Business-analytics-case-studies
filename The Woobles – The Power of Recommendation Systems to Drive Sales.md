# Case Study: The Woobles – The Power of Recommendation Systems to Drive Sales

---

## Challenge  

E-commerce stores often display product recommendations to encourage additional purchases.  
For **The Woobles**, a crochet kit e-commerce store, the challenge was:  

- Ensuring the **right products** are recommended to the **right customers** at the **right time**.  
- Increasing sales through personalized product suggestions.  
- Managing recommendations **without the expertise or time** to build ML models internally.  

As Adrian (co-founder) described:  
> “Working with machine learning is a black box. You plug things in and hope something good happens. It’s helpful to know what machine learning is looking at, but as an entrepreneur, I wouldn’t want to know all the ins and outs.”

## The Approach  

The Woobles combined **machine learning** (via Shopify) with **analytics** (via Google Analytics + Triple Whale) to optimize recommendations.  

### Automated Recommendations  
- Displayed at the bottom of each product page.  
- Powered by **Shopify’s machine learning algorithm**, which uses:  
  - **Collaborative Filtering** → Purchase history patterns (items bought together).  
  - **Content-Based Filtering** → Product similarities (e.g., beginner kits closer to beginner kits).  
  - **NLP (Bag of Words)** → Tokenizing product descriptions, building a document-term matrix, and calculating similarity distances.  

### Hybrid Approach  
- **Machine-driven**: Shopify auto-generates recommendations.  
- **Human-driven**: Woobles team uses web analytics to adjust and validate product suggestions.

## The Results  

- **Increased Sales**: Personalized recommendations improved cart values and conversions.  
- **Customer Experience**: Shoppers discover relevant products faster.  
- **Efficiency Gains**: ~5 hours/month saved from manual product updates.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Automated personalization requires no additional staff time.

## The Future  

The Woobles plans to expand machine learning applications by implementing **chatbots** to:  
- Answer customer questions about products, shipping, billing, and tutorials.  
- Support customer acquisition via automated, conversational education.  

These chatbots would rely on:  
- **NLP (Bag of Words, n-grams)** to interpret customer input.  
- **Unsupervised learning** for clustering queries.  
- **Supervised learning** to predict the best responses.

## Key Takeaways  

- **Recommendation engines** often combine content-based and collaborative filtering, enhanced by NLP.  
- **ML-driven automation saves time**, letting entrepreneurs focus on growth instead of manual tasks.  
- **Sales data + customer trends analysis** are critical in optimizing recommendations.  
- **Chatbots** represent the next frontier, reducing time spent on customer support and education.
